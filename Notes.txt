MetaMask Test Eth Networks:
    Rinkeby - 3 TestEth from https://www.rinkeby.io/#faucet
    Ropsten - ERROR 500 (check later or use Glitter)
    Goerli - ERROR 500 (check later - when twitter acct is a week old)

MetaMask <--> Infura (Block Explorer - uses RESTful API connects to chain node) <--> Blockchain Node <--> Blockchain Network

MetaMask Behind the Scenes Takeaways:
    - You need a blockchain node to interact with the blockchain 
    - Blockchain is "the single source of truth" - shared ledger allowing us all access to the data

Gas is a transactional fee taken on Eth transfers

Transactional Objects:
    from: [account]
    to: [account](optional)
    value: [integer] in wei
    /-- additional objects --\
    gas: maximum amount of gas used
    gasPrice: amount of wei per gas
    data: ABI byte string (optional)
    nonce: Integer of a nonce (integer that is incremented every time a transaction is sent - security measure to avoid replay attacks)

Signatures:
    - used to verify authenticity of a transaction and prevent malicious transfer activities
    - https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.11/web3-eth-accounts.html#signtransaction
    - web3.eth.accounts.signTransaction(tx, privateKey [, callback]);

    Signature Process Breakdown:

        Transaction {
            from: [sending account address]
            to: [receiving account address]
            value: [amount to send]
        }
        - MetaMask signs transaction with Private Key - 32-bytes (64 hex characters)
        - Private Key is send through ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm) to generate a Public Key
        - Public Key is passed to Eth account
        - Private Key is used to sign transaction
        - Signature (private key) can then be verified by comparing public key and eth account (both generated off of private key) using an ECRECOVER function
